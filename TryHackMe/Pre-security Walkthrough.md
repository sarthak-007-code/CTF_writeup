# **TryHackMe Pre-Security Path Walkthrough**

### **A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started in Cybersecurity**

The TryHackMe Pre-Security path is a fantastic starting point for anyone interested in cybersecurity. It's a structured learning plan designed to take you from a complete beginner to having the foundational knowledge required for more advanced hacking concepts. Instead of providing a list of answers, this write-up is a guide to the key concepts and a methodology for completing the path successfully.

### **1\. Network Fundamentals**

This is the first and most crucial module. Understanding how networks function is essential for a career in cybersecurity.

#### **Key Concepts to Master:**

* **The OSI Model:** Don't just memorize the 7 layers; understand the purpose of each one and what happens at each layer.  
* **TCP/IP:** Grasp the difference between TCP (connection-oriented) and UDP (connectionless).  
* **Ports:** Learn about common ports and the services that run on them (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP, Port 22 for SSH).  
* **Protocols:** Understand the role of protocols like HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and ARP.

#### **Methodology:**

* **Read Carefully:** This module is heavy on theory. Take your time to read every paragraph and don't skip over the diagrams.  
* **Use ping and traceroute:** The rooms will have you use these commands. Don't just copy and paste; try to understand what each command is doing and what the output means.  
* **Visualize:** Use tools like a network visualizer to see how data moves across a network.

### **2\. Linux Fundamentals**

Linux is the hacker's operating system. Mastering the command line is non-negotiable for a career in this field.

#### **Key Concepts to Master:**

* **Filesystem Navigation:** Learn how to move around the file system with cd (change directory) and ls (list files).  
* **File Permissions:** Understand the rwx (read, write, execute) permissions and how to change them with chmod.  
* **File Manipulation:** Learn to create (touch), copy (cp), move (mv), and remove (rm) files and directories.  
* **Users and Groups:** Understand how users and groups interact with the system.

#### **Methodology:**

* **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The best way to learn Linux is by doing. Don't just read about the commands; open a terminal and use them repeatedly.  
* **Use the man command:** If you don't know what a command does, use man \<command\> to read its manual page. This is a fundamental skill.  
* **Pivoting:** The later rooms in the path will require you to combine commands using pipes (|) and redirection (\>).

### **3\. Web Fundamentals**

This module provides a crucial look into how the web works and introduces you to common web vulnerabilities.

#### **Key Concepts to Master:**

* **HTTP:** Understand the basics of HTTP requests and responses (GET, POST).  
* **URLs:** Know the different parts of a URL (protocol, domain, path, query parameters).  
* **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** Grasp the purpose of each. HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for functionality.  
* **Cookies and Sessions:** Learn how these are used to manage state on the web.

#### **Methodology:**

* **Use the Browser Developer Tools:** These tools are your best friend. Use the Inspect Element feature to view the HTML and CSS of a webpage. Use the Network tab to see the HTTP requests and responses.  
* **Read the Source Code:** Always view the source code of the webpage in the provided challenges. Sometimes, answers are hidden in comments or simple JavaScript variables.  
* **Test Input Fields:** Be curious and try to input unexpected values into forms and search bars to see how the application reacts.

### **4\. Concluding the Path**

The final rooms in the Pre-Security path combine the knowledge you've gained from the previous modules. Don't be afraid to go back and review older rooms if you get stuck. The ability to revisit and reinforce your knowledge is a key trait of a good learner.  
Completing this path doesn't make you a professional hacker, but it gives you a solid foundation to build upon. You now have the necessary vocabulary and skills to tackle more complex topics like network penetration testing, web application hacking, and cryptography. The journey has just begun\!
